## Description:
 My personal portfolio featuring projects completed while attending UW's full-stack coding bootcamp in 2021.

## Technologies_used:
* Mongo DB
* Express.js
* React
* Node.js
* Mongoose.js

## Usage:
The app features information about six selected projects completed while attending UW coding bootcamp. The information is fed from an api featuring  a lot of my work. The projects are displayed with a screenshot and a short description, links to the deployed app, links to the app's repo, technologies used in creating the app and all authors of the app. There is contact info at the bottom of the page including a link to my resume, a mailto link to my email address. 

## Future_Development:
I plan on adding more projects to the database and render said projects onto the browse page. An intro page will be added with a longer bio and more personal information. The cards on the 'browse' page will be stripped down info wise and a click to go to project page function will be added. The project page will have all project info.
